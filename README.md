# Computer-Vision-Model

This project is a Computer Vision model that I made to detect dalmatians. I chose dalmations becuase they are a relatively easy object to detect as a human, and I didn't know if I had the time or processing power to train a model on more ambiguous objects such as a house.

For this project, I designed and created a Computer Vision AI model using a Convolutional Neural Network (specifically Darknet with YOLOv3) and self-curated training data. Although, I did use the OpenCV library as a base for the YOLO model to transfer some learning over and speed up the process.
